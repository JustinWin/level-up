# Level Up!
## A Gamified Task Scheduler

## Project Description
The user can create various tasks that they want to keep track of. Then the user can set an alarm to remind them of the task and a timer for how long they want to spend on the task. By completing a task, the user will gain “experience points” based on how long they spent on a task. Experience points will allow the user to level up in certain skills such as studying, working, or fitness. Reaching certain levels will reward the user with badges or achievements in those skills.
